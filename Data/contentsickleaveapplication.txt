Dear [Manager's Name],

I am writing to inform you that I am unable to come to work for the next few days due to illness. I woke up this morning feeling unwell and have since seen a doctor who has advised me to take some time off to rest and recover.

I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and will do my best to make up for any lost time upon my return. I will keep you updated on my progress and let you know as soon as I am able to return to work.

Thank you for your understanding.

Sincerely,
Hamza [Your Name]
