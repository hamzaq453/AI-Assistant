Dear [Manager's Name],

I am writing to inform you that I am not feeling well and will be unable to come to work today. I woke up this morning with a high fever and severe body aches, and I think it would be best for me to rest and recover at home.

I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and will make sure to catch up on any missed work as soon as I am feeling better. I will keep you updated on my condition and let you know as soon as I am able to return to work.

Thank you for your understanding.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
