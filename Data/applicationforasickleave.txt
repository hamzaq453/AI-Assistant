Dear [Recipient's Name],

I am writing to inform you that I am unable to come to work for the next few days due to illness. I woke up this morning feeling unwell and after consulting with my doctor, it has been determined that I need to take some time off to recover.

I am currently experiencing [describe your symptoms here], and my doctor has advised me to rest and avoid any strenuous activity for the time being. I will be monitoring my condition closely and will return to work as soon as I am medically cleared to do so.

In the meantime, I will do my best to ensure that my responsibilities are covered while I am away. I have delegated my tasks to [name of the person who will be handling your responsibilities], and I am confident that they will be able to handle everything in my absence.

I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your understanding during this time. If you need any additional information or have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me at [your phone number] or [your email address].

Thank you for your support.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
